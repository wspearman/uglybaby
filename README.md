#Objective - Design (or locate existing) Java Applet(s) (or whatever is most appropriate) with the following abilities:
#1. Simple easy "login" and account creation much like github's (including email verification prior to uploading).
#2. Allow users to upload a photo and assign it a unique identifier.
#3. Simple viewing of uploaded photos for anyone. (again, github has a good implementation in the gist display that could be adapted for usage by #uglybaby)
#4. Each photo allows viewer to vote on an image, giving it a score of 1-10.
#5. Calculate average of all votes to create a score for each unique photo
#6. Track individual IP addresses to prevent multiple voting (dailybeast allows voting by non-registered people, then displays a warning asking not to downvote without having an account, not sure if downvote is counted, but this routine may be suitable)
